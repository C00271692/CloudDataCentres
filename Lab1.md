1. *Enabled

2. Accessibility, affordability, No maintenance required (as a client of such service).
Pros: accesibility, affordability, no maintenance
Cons: Huge amounts of power needed, many Acres of land, mass surveillance 

3. The hypervisor is responsible for creating and managing virtual machines. It acts as a layer between the physical hardware and the virtual machines, allocating resources (such as CPU, memory, and storage) and ensuring each VM runs in an isolated environment.

4. A virtual machine is like an emulatior of a physical computer. It runs its own operating system and applications as if it were a separate physical machine, all while sharing the underlying hardware resources managed by the hypervisor.

5. Resource Optimization: Allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical host, maximizing hardware utilization.
Isolation: Each VM operates in its own sandbox, reducing the risk of system-wide issues.
Flexibility: Simplifies tasks like deployment, scaling, and migration.
Cost Efficiency: Reduces the need for physical hardware, lowering capital and operational expenses.
Backup and Recovery: Facilitates easier backup, snapshotting, and disaster recovery processes.

6. Server Consolidation: Running several servers on one physical machine to improve efficiency.
Development and Testing: Creating isolated environments for developing and testing software without affecting the production system.
Disaster Recovery: Quickly restoring services by reverting to VM snapshots or clones.
Legacy Application Support: Running outdated applications in a controlled virtual environment when newer hardware may not support them.
Cloud Computing: Delivering scalable, on-demand services by hosting VMs in the cloud.

7. b) The operating system installed on a virtual machine.

8. c) Virtual machines run independently and are isolated from each other and the host system.

9. c) It allows virtual machines to be moved between different physical machines with compatible hypervisors.

10. Cloning a virtual machine creates an exact duplicate of an existing VM, including its operating system, applications, and settings. This is particularly useful for quickly deploying new instances, setting up testing or development environments, ensuring consistency across deployments, and simplifying backup or recovery operations.
